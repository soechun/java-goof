## Java Goof Test

A vulnerable demo application, initially based on [Ben Hassine](https://github.com/benas/)'s [TodoMVC](https://github.com/benas/todolist-mvc). 

The goal of this application is to demonstrate through example how to find, exploit and fix vulnerable Maven packages. 

This repo is still incomplete, a work in progress to support related presentations.
